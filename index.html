                <h2>About</h2>
		<p>The "Perspective Argument Retrieval" task addresses the often-overlooked challenge of incorporating socio-demographic information (such as political views, age, and gender) in argument retrieval. By focusing on these aspects, we acknowledge their potential latent influence on argumentation.</p>

                <p>With this shared task, we invite the community to develop methods that concentrate on this crucial area and advance state-of-the-art retrieval models by considering the perspective of societal diversity.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section" id="task">
            <h2>Task Description</h2>
		<p>Argument retrieval is the task of retrieving a set of top-k relevant arguments out of a corpus given a specific query. With this proposal, we formulate perspective argument retrieval as an expansion of argument retrieval with socio-demographic information. Concretely, this shared task proposes three scenarios of varying difficulties to considering socio-demographic profiles. Therefore, we want to foster approaches taking into account latent aspects of argumentation beyond semantic features, such as personal attitude. We consider these aspects both during retrieval and evaluation. </p>
            <h3>Retrieval Scenarios</h3>
                <p>This shared task distinguishes between three different retrieval scenarios with increasing difficulty. Note, we show in the Appendix A. baseline results for the first scenario. These results represent the lower bound of the expected performance and show that the first scenario with the lowest difficulty is generally solvable with sufficient performance.

Scenario 1: Baseline retrieval of relevant arguments given a specific query from a given corpus. Therefore, we evaluate the general abilities of a system to retrieve relevant arguments.
Example query: Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar (sugar tax)?
Example relevant candidates: The reduction of sugar in food should be pushed. Not every food needs additional sugar as a supplement.

Scenario 2: Explicit perspectivism extends the baseline task by explicitly adding socio-demographic information to the query and the corpus and limiting the relevant candidates to arguments from authors matching the corresponding demographic information. With this second scenario, we test whether a retrieval system can consider socio-demographic properties when explicitly mentioned in the query and the candidates.
Example query: Given a left attitude, are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar (sugar tax)?
Example relevant candidates: With a left attitude, reducing sugar in food should be pushed. Not every food needs additional sugar as a supplement.

Scenario 3: Implicit perspectivism This scenario is similar to explicit perspectivism, but we only add socio-demographic information to the query. Therefore, we test the ability of a retrieval system to account for latently encoded socio-demographic information within the argument.
Example query: Given a liberal attitude, are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar (sugar tax)?
Example relevant candidates: Eating is an individual decision. It doesn't need a nanny state.</p>

                <h3>Retrieval Evaluation</h3>
                <p>We employ for all three scenarios a two-folded evaluation for a comprehensive measure of the retrieval quality. Concretely, we distinguish between relevance and diversity:
With relevance, we focus on the ability of a retrieval system to select the relevant candidates, for example, all arguments addressing the queried issue for the baseline scenario or arguments that additionally match specific demographic properties for explicit or implicit perspectivism. Following previous work (Bondarenko et al., 2020; Bondarenko et al. 2022., 2022; Thakur et al., 2021), we use the nDCG@ and precision@ metric.
Using diversity, we account for the influence of perspectivism in the evaluation by measuring whether a retrieval system proposes arguments balanced regarding the stance distribution and the authors' demographic properties (such as gender or political attitude). Following previous studies regarding fairness in argument retrieval systems (Pathiyan Cherumanal et al., 2021), we calculate alpha-DCG@ and s-precision@ for all these properties separately and average them afterward. Note, since we condition on specific demographic properties in the query for explicit or implicit perspectivism (scenarios 2 and 3), these conditioned properties are withheld. </p>

            <section class="section" id="data">
                <h2>Data</h2>
		<p>This shared task is grounded on the x-stance dataset (Vamvas & Sennrich, 2020), providing arguments annotated with their stance regarding different political issues gathered from the voting recommendation platform https://www.smartvote.ch/. This platform provides voting suggestions based on a questionnaire that politicians and voters fill out. Therein, politicians can argue why they are in favor or against specific political issues. We use these arguments covering the 2019 Swiss Federal elections as a corpus and the political issues as queries. Afterward, we enrich these arguments with a total of 13 socio-demographic properties, either provided by the voting platform itself (gender, age, party, …) or derived from the filled-out questionnaire of the politicians (political attitude, important political aspects, …). This collection encapsulates 5,952 arguments and 62 queries. This data is multilingual and covers German, French, and Italian. For simplicity, we provide examples translated into English in the following.
We generate the train and test splits by considering 48 queries as training queries and 14 as development queries, while the argument corpus is used for both sets. Apart from the queries for the baseline scenario, we will also provide queries for the perspectivism scenarios, including socio-demographic information. While the x-stance dataset is publicly available, we will compose two secret test sets:
A set of queries and arguments covering the 2023 Swiss Federal election. For this composition, we will follow the same procedure as done for the x-stance dataset.
Furthermore, we will conduct a user study to provide a set of high-quality annotations from a voter's perspective. Therefore, we let potential voters annotate relevant arguments regarding specific political issues. Along with these annotations, we will collect their socio-demographic profiles, allowing us to formulate specific queries representing them.
</p>
                <h3>Socio-Demographic Properties</h3>
<p>We describe the socio-demographic profile of an author using the properties given by smartvote.ch. This includes eight personal properties: gender, age, party, focal point of life, occupation, education, civil status, denomination, and political attitude. In addition, we track whether one of the following political issues is essential, neutral, or not important: open foreign policy, liberal economic policy, restrictive financial policy, law & order, restrictive migration policy, expanded environmental protection.</p>
            <h3>Dataformat</h3>
                <p>We will provide the data as two types of JSON files: the corpus.jsonl, which consists of the collection of arguments, and the authors' socio-demographic profile. In addition, we provide in baseline_train.jsonl and perspectivsm_train.json the specific queries and the relevant candidates, including, if so, the considered socio-demographic properties.
Example corpus.jsonl
[{
    	"argument_id": ""<"argument_id">"",
    	"text": "Eating is an individual decision. It doesn't need a nanny state.",
	"target": "Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar …",
    	"stance": "CON",
	“demographic_profile”: {...}
}, …]
Example baseline_train.jsonl
[{
    	"query_id": "<"query_id">",
    	"text": "Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar …",
	"relevant_candiates": [23, 4623, 65, 321, …]
},...]
Example perspectivsm_train.jsonl
[{
    	"query_id": ""<"query_id">"",
    	"text": "Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar …",
	“demographic_properties”: {
		"political_attitude": "liberal"
}
	"relevant_candiates": [23, 4623, 65, 321, …]
},...]</p>
