        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The "Perspective Argument Retrieval" task addresses the often-overlooked challenge of incorporating
            socio-demographic information (such as political views, age, and gender) in argument retrieval. By focusing
            on these aspects, we acknowledge their potential latent influence on argumentation.</p>

        <p>With this shared task, we invite the community to develop methods that concentrate on this crucial area and
            advance state-of-the-art retrieval models by considering the perspective of societal diversity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="task">
    <h2>Task Description</h2>
    <p class="smaller-font">Argument retrieval is the task of retrieving a set of top-k relevant arguments out of a corpus given a
        specific query. With this proposal, we formulate perspective argument retrieval as an expansion of argument
        retrieval with socio-demographic information. Concretely, this shared task proposes three scenarios of
        varying difficulties to considering socio-demographic profiles. Therefore, we want to foster approaches
        taking into account latent aspects of argumentation beyond semantic features, such as personal attitude. We
        consider these aspects both during retrieval and evaluation. </p>
    <h3>Retrieval Scenarios</h3>
    <p class="smaller-font">This shared task distinguishes between three different retrieval scenarios with increasing difficulty. Note,
        we show in the Appendix A. baseline results for the first scenario. These results represent the lower bound
        of the expected performance and show that the first scenario with the lowest difficulty is generally
        solvable with sufficient performance.
        <br>
        <strong>Scenario 1: Baseline</strong> retrieval of relevant arguments given a specific query from a given
        corpus. Therefore,
        we evaluate the general abilities of a system to retrieve relevant arguments.
        Example query: <em>Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar (sugar tax)?</em>
        Example relevant candidates: <em>The reduction of sugar in food should be pushed. Not every food needs
            additional sugar as a supplement.</em>
        <br>
        <strong>Scenario 2: Explicit perspectivism</strong> extends the baseline task by explicitly adding
        socio-demographic
        information to the query and the corpus and limiting the relevant candidates to arguments from authors
        matching the corresponding demographic information. With this second scenario, we test whether a retrieval
        system can consider socio-demographic properties when explicitly mentioned in the query and the candidates.
        Example query: <em>Given a left attitude, are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing
            sugar (sugar tax)?</em>
        Example relevant candidates: <em>With a left attitude, reducing sugar in food should be pushed. Not every food
            needs additional sugar as a supplement.</em>
        <br>
        <strong>Scenario 3: Implicit perspectivism</strong> This scenario is similar to explicit perspectivism, but
        we only add
        socio-demographic information to the query. Therefore, we test the ability of a retrieval system to account
        for latently encoded socio-demographic information within the argument.
        Example query: <em>Given a liberal attitude, are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing
            sugar (sugar tax)?</em>
        Example relevant candidates: <em>Eating is an individual decision. It doesn't need a nanny state.</em></p>

    <h3>Retrieval Evaluation</h3>
    <p class="smaller-font">We employ for all three scenarios a two-folded evaluation for a comprehensive measure of the retrieval
        quality. Concretely, we distinguish between <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>diversity</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p class="smaller-font">
            With <strong>relevance</strong>, we focus on the ability of a retrieval system to select the relevant
            candidates, for
            example, all arguments addressing the queried issue for the <strong>baseline scenario</strong> or
            arguments that
            additionally
            match specific demographic properties for <strong>explicit</strong> or <strong>implicit</strong>
            perspectivism. Following previous work
            (Bondarenko et al., 2020; Bondarenko et al. 2022., 2022; Thakur et al., 2021), we use the nDCG@ and
            precision@ metric.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p class="smaller-font">
                Using diversity, we account for the influence of perspectivism in the evaluation by measuring
                whether a
                retrieval system proposes arguments balanced regarding the stance distribution and the authors'
                demographic
                properties (such as gender or political attitude). Following previous studies regarding fairness in
                argument
                retrieval systems (Pathiyan Cherumanal et al., 2021), we calculate alpha-DCG@ and s-precision@ for
                all these
                properties separately and average them afterward. Note, since we condition on specific demographic
                properties in the query for explicit or implicit perspectivism (scenarios 2 and 3), these
                conditioned
                properties are withheld.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="data">
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p class="smaller-font">This shared task is grounded on the x-stance dataset (Vamvas & Sennrich, 2020), providing arguments annotated
            with their stance regarding different political issues gathered from the voting recommendation platform
            https://www.smartvote.ch/. This platform provides voting suggestions based on a questionnaire that
            politicians and voters fill out. Therein, politicians can argue why they are in favor or against specific
            political issues.</p>
        <p class="smaller-font">We use these arguments covering the 2019 Swiss Federal elections as a corpus and the political issues as
            queries. Afterward, we enrich these arguments with a total of 13 socio-demographic properties, either
            provided by the voting platform itself (gender, age, party, …) or derived from the filled-out questionnaire
            of the politicians (political attitude, important political aspects, …). This collection encapsulates 5,952
            arguments and 62 queries. This data is multilingual and covers German, French, and Italian. For simplicity,
            we provide examples translated into English in the following.</p>
        <p class="smaller-font">
            We generate the train and test splits by considering 48 queries as training queries and 14 as development
            queries, while the argument corpus is used for both sets. Apart from the queries for the
            <strong>baseline</strong> scenario,
            we will also provide queries for the <strong>perspectivism</strong> scenarios, including socio-demographic
            information. While
            the x-stance dataset is publicly available, we will compose two secret test sets:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="smaller-font">
            1. A set of queries and arguments covering the 2023 Swiss Federal election. For this composition, we will
            follow the same procedure as done for the x-stance dataset.
            <br>
            2. Furthermore, we will conduct a user study to provide a set of high-quality annotations from a voter's
            perspective. Therefore, we let potential voters annotate relevant arguments regarding specific political
            issues. Along with these annotations, we will collect their socio-demographic profiles, allowing us to
            formulate specific queries representing them.
        </p>
        <h3>Socio-Demographic Properties</h3>
        <p class="smaller-font">We describe the socio-demographic profile of an author using the properties given by smartvote.ch. This
            includes eight personal properties: gender, age, party, focal point of life, occupation, education, civil
            status, denomination, and political attitude. In addition, we track whether one of the following political
            issues is essential, neutral, or not important: open foreign policy, liberal economic policy, restrictive
            financial policy, law & order, restrictive migration policy, expanded environmental protection.</p>
        <h3>Dataformat</h3>
        <p class="smaller-font">
            We will provide the data in the form of two JSON file types. The first, named <code>corpus.jsonl</code>,
            will consist of a collection of arguments along with the authors' socio-demographic profiles. The second
            type includes <code>baseline_train.jsonl</code> and <code>perspectivsm_train.jsonl</code>, which contain
            specific queries and the relevant candidates, as well as any considered socio-demographic properties, where
            applicable.
        </p>
        <p>Here are examples of what these JSON files will look like:</p>
        <p><strong>Example corpus.jsonl:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>[
  {
    "argument_id": "&lt;argument_id&gt;",
    "text": "Eating is an individual decision. It doesn't need a nanny state.",
    "target": "Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar …",
    "stance": "CON",
    "demographic_profile": {...}
  },
  ...
]</code></pre>

        <p><strong>Example baseline_train.jsonl:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>[
  {
    "query_id": "&lt;query_id&gt;",
    "text": "Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar …",
    "relevant_candidates": [23, 4623, 65, 321, ...]
  },
  ...
]</code></pre>

        <p><strong>Example perspectivsm_train.jsonl:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>[
  {
    "query_id": "&lt;query_id&gt;",
    "text": "Are you in favor of the introduction of a tax on foods containing sugar …",
    "demographic_properties": {
      "political_attitude": "liberal"
    },
    "relevant_candidates": [23, 4623, 65, 321, ...]
  },
  ...
]</code></pre>
